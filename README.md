# Snake Retro

A retro-style [snake game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyhzCBEGaBY&t=1834s) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Classic snake game mechanics
- Retro design and aesthetics
- Responsive controls

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alexcoy06/snake-retro.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd snake-retro
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

- Use arrow keys to control the snake.
- Eat the food to grow and score points.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's body.

## Improvements

- For those those that are avid gamers such as myself I add the option to use W, A, S, D
- I implemented Collision detection for the snake crossing over itself
  - Part of that  prompted me to create logic so that if you're going in One Direction you can't immediately go in the opposite
